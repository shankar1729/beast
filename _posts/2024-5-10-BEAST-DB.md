The BEAST DB database brings together high-quality grand-canonical DFT calculations
for explicit modeling of potential-dependence of electrochemical reactions.
The DB already includes HER, OER, CO2R and NRR reactions on over 2000 catalysts,
and will be continously expanded.

Check out the [database here](https://beastdb.nrel.gov) and 
see the [NREL press release](https://www.nrel.gov/news/program/2024/new-database-aims-to-accelerate-electrocatalyst-development-through-atomic-scale-insights.html) for more information.
