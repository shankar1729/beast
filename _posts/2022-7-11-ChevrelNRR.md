The nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) is a renewable alternative to the energy- and CO2-intensive Haber–Bosch NH<sub>3</sub> synthesis process but is severely limited by the low activity and selectivity of studied electrocatalysts. The Chevrel phase Fe<sub>2</sub>Mo<sub>6</sub>S<sub>8</sub> has a surface Fe–S–Mo coordination environment that mimics the nitrogenase FeMo-cofactor and was recently shown to provide state-of-the-art activity and selectivity for NRR. Here, we elucidate the previously unknown NRR mechanism on Fe<sub>2</sub>Mo<sub>6</sub>S<sub>8</sub> via grand-canonical density functional theory (GC-DFT) that realistically models solvated and biased surfaces. Fe sites of Fe<sub>2</sub>Mo<sub>6</sub>S<sub>8</sub> selectively stabilize the key *NNH intermediate via a narrow band of free-atom-like surface d-states that selectively hybridize with p-states of *NNH, which results in Fe sites breaking NRR scaling relationships. These sharp d-states arise from an Fe–S bond dissociation during N<sub>2</sub> adsorption that mimics the mechanism of the nitrogenase FeMo-cofactor. Furthermore, we developed a new GC-DFT-based approach for calculating transition states as a function of bias (GC-NEB) and applied it to produce a microkinetic model for NRR at Fe<sub>2</sub>Mo<sub>6</sub>S<sub>8</sub> that predicts high activity and selectivity, in close agreement with experiments. Our results suggest new design principles that may identify effective NRR electrocatalysts that minimize the barriers for *N<sub>2</sub> protonation and *NH<sub>3</sub> desorption and that may be broadly applied to the rational discovery of stable, multinary electrocatalysts for other reactions where narrow bands of surface d-states can be tuned to selectively stabilize key reaction intermediates and guide selectivity toward a target product. Furthermore, our results highlight the importance of using GC-DFT and GC-NEB to accurately model electrocatalytic reactions.
