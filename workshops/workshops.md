# Annual BEAST workshops

The BEAST team plans annual workshops to introduce computational electrochemistry using grand-canonical DFT, advanced solvation models and beyond-DFT methods.
These workshops will also highlight the latest techniques developed by the BEAST team, that are ready for use by the community through the JDFTx and BerkeleyGW open-source code, as well as the data generated by the project through the [BEAST DB](https://beastdb.nrel.gov).
See the workshop pages of each year for further details on the content.
